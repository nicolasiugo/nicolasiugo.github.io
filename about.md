Hi! I'm Nicol√°s, a software engineer from Montevideo, Uruguay. I have over 10 years of experience in the web development industry. I have taken projects from idea to production, working on architecture, frontend and backend development and leading agile teams. 

I love reading, I read anything that falls into my hands.
