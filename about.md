Hi! I'm Nicol√°s, a software engineer from Montevideo, Uruguay. I have over 10 years of experience in the web development industry. I have taken projects from idea to production, working on architecture, frontend and backend development and leading agile teams. 

I love reading, I read anything that falls into my hands. I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12652457-the-broken-eye">The Broken Eye (Lightbringer #3)</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers</a>.
